Credit Card Fraud Detection - Sampling and Model Evaluation
This project demonstrates how to apply various sampling techniques to balance an imbalanced credit card fraud dataset and evaluate different machine learning models on the balanced data. The goal is to identify which sampling technique provides the best performance for each model.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Creditcard data, which can be downloaded from:

Creditcard_data.csv

Key Steps
Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset.
Class Imbalance Handling: Apply 5 different sampling techniques to balance the dataset:
SMOTE, Random Undersampling, Tomek, Random Oversampling, NearMiss
Model Training: Train 5 machine learning models:
Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, SVM, knn
Model Evaluation: Compare the accuracy of models with different sampling techniques.
Results: Visualize and analyze the accuracy of each combination.

Conclusion
This project aims to identify the best sampling technique for class imbalance in fraud detection tasks and helps to improve the performance of machine learning models.
